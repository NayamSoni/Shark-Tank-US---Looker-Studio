# Shark-Tank-US---Looker-Studio
Participated in Shark Tank US dataset challenge on Linkedin. As part of a challenge presented by Onyx Data, I took on the task of creating a dynamic and insightful dashboard.

ğŸŒŸDashboard link - https://lnkd.in/gKYEV8NP

ğŸ“ˆI have done analysis season-wise and also have calculated the Top startups based on the highest investments.

ğŸ“ˆI have discovered that the Food and Beverage industry is popular among all industries whereas there were only 8 episodes of liquor and alcohol.

ğŸ“ˆSeason 6 had witnessed the highest Deal Amount.

ğŸ“ˆAirCar was the startup with the highest investment amount.

ğŸ“ˆOverall Mark Cuban Shark has invested the highest amount.

and many more which can be visualised with the help of the dashboard.
